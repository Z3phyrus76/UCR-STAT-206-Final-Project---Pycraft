"""
models.py

Purpose:
Builds and evaluates a logistic regression model to predict cancellations.

What this file does:
- Splits data into train and test sets
- Runs logistic regression
- Calculates accuracy and ROC AUC
- Returns evaluation results

Why it exists:
Keeps modeling separate from cleaning and feature engineering.
Makes the project reusable and structured.
